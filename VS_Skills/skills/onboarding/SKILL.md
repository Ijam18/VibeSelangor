# 🚀 Welcome to the Project!

We're excited to have you on board. This guide will help you get set up and start contributing quickly.

## 📌 VibeSelangor: Our Mission
**VibeSelangor** is a community-driven initiative to empower developers in Selangor and beyond to build impactful applications using AI.

### Core Values
-   **Community First**: We build for the people.
-   **Vibe High**: Coding should be fun and creative.
-   **Ship Fast**: We use AI to move from idea to product in record time.

## 🏮 Local Best Practices
-   **Learn the Map**: Don't just stay in your "Home." Explore other "Districts" (folders) to see how others build.
-   **Ping the Locals**: Ask questions in the group chat. We are a community of Builders.
-   **Vibe-Check Your Tools**: Ensure your Virtual Proxy (AI Agent) is always updated with the latest context.

## 🧠 The Vibe Mental Model
Understanding your environment is key. Think of it this way:
-   **The Computer** = Your **State**.
-   **The Hard Drive** = High-level **Districts**.
-   **Folders** = **Homes** that house all the "living" files and apps.
-   **AI Tools** = Your **Virtual Proxy**. They navigate the State, visit Districts, and work in Homes on your behalf.

> **Note on Installations**: When you install a tool (like `npm install`), you are essentially furnishing the "Home" with the appliances your Virtual Proxy needs to do its job.

## 🛠️ Tooling & Setup
Before you dive into the code, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

1.  **Cursor Editor**: Our primary IDE. Ensure you have the latest version.
2.  **Antigravity Agent**: Your AI pair programmer.
3.  **Supabase CLI**: For local database development (if applicable).
4.  **Node.js & npm**: Ensure you're on the LST version.

### Setup Steps:
1.  **Clone the Repo**: `git clone [repository-url]`
2.  **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
3.  **Copy Env**: `cp .env.example .env` (Ask a team lead for the values).
4.  **Run Dev**: `npm run dev`

## 🎭 Culture & Communication
- **Vibe Coding**: We embrace "vibe coding" (see the `vibe-coding` skill).
- **Discord/Slack**: [Insert Link] is our primary communication channel.
- **Standups**: Everyday at [Time] in [Location/Link].

## 📂 Local Resources
We have a local reference project available on your desktop:
`c:\Users\ssahrom\Desktop\AntiGravity\VibeSelangor`

This folder contains:
-   **SkillCreator.md**: Advanced guide for building skills.
-   **Source Code**: Example implementation of a VibeSelangor app.
-   **Styling**: Reference for our design system.

## ✅ First PR Checklist
